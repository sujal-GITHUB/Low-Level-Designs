# Low Level Designs

A collection of **Low-Level Design (LLD) implementations** in C++ (and other languages). Each project demonstrates **real-world system design problems** using **OOP, design patterns, and clean architecture principles**.

---

## üìñ Overview

This repository is intended for **practice and learning of LLD concepts**. Each folder/project contains a complete implementation of a system design problem, including:

- Class design with **OOP principles**  
- Usage of **design patterns** where applicable  
- Sample `main()` demonstrating functionality  
- Comments and explanations for better understanding  

---

Each project folder contains its **own README** explaining:  

- Design overview  
- Class relationships  
- How to run the code  
- Sample output  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sujal-GITHUB/Low-Level-Designs.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
```
cd low-level-design-practice/Project1
```
3. Compile the C++ code:
```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
4. Run the executable:
```
./main
```
