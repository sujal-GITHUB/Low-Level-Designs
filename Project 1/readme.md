# Q&A System (Low-Level Design Implementation)

This project is a **C++ implementation of a Q&A system**, inspired by platforms like StackOverflow. It demonstrates **object-oriented design**, **class relationships**, and **basic system functionalities** such as posting questions, answering, commenting, voting, and tracking user reputation.

## üìñ Overview

The system models a Q&A platform with the following entities:

- **User**: Can post questions, answer questions, comment, and vote.
- **Question**: Contains the question text, tags, votes, comments, and related answers.
- **Answer**: Contains answer text, votes, comments, and links to its question.
- **System**: Singleton class that manages users, questions, answers, and mappings between them.

Key features implemented:

- Add, delete, and retrieve users, questions, and answers.
- Users can post questions and answers.
- Users can comment on questions and answers.
- Voting system for questions and answers (upvote/downvote).
- Reputation calculation:
  - 1 question ‚Üí +100 points  
  - 1 answer ‚Üí +500 points
